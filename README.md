## Thoughts
I wrote this program because I wanted something to whet my skills
on. When I first wanted to get into programming, I wanted
a Snake-like game to support a blockchain education platform we wanted to build.
I soon realized I had absolutely no idea how computers actually worked, much less how to code a
game (or freaking education platform!)

As of this writing, that was a little over 5 years ago. It was not
a linear path to get here by any means but it feels great to finally code Snake.

I learned or improved on the following while making this program:

- Event-driven/GUI programming [GUI Programming Help](http://www.alan-g.me.uk/tutor/tutgui.htm)
- Python OOP and virtual environments
- [tkinter](http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/)
- State-driven application architecture
- and of course, the Linked Lists data structure!!
